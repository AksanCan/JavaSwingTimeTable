# JavaSwingTimeTable
Java Swing app that creates time tables optional in word, pdf or excel. This app was build as a part of a course I took during my bachelor degree with three other students.

The user is asked to provide an adjacent matrix of a network where each vertice is associated with a number (possible infinit, which shall be indicated thruw the letter e).

This network is interpreted as a a public transport network and the numbers represent the time the public transport takes to get from one node to an other.
By using numerical algorithms (which can be choosed by the user) for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the so called max plus algebra this app creates a cyclic schedule under which the public transport runs at consistent time intervalls.

The time table can alternativaly be created as a word, pdf or excel file.
